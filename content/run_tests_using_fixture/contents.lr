# Hooks
The hook-based plugin architecture of pytest empowers you to heavily customize the test runners behavior. In this particular case we'll make use of the ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` hook. It is called after collection has been performed and hence provides access to the actual test items - objects which represent a single test.

# Fixtures
Hooks have access to pytest's builtin fixtures such as ``config``. We case use it to explicitly run a hook for deselecting test items, namely ``config.hook.pytest_deselected``. 

# Items
This hook does not a return the test items. Instead you want to populate the given list as needed: ``items[:] = selected_items``

# Implicit Fixture Usage
Pytests modular design allows you to re-use fixtures. The ``fixturenames`` attribute of a test item not only holds the fixtures which are specified in its signature but also the ones that are used implicitly.

# Example Implementation
```python
# conftest.py

def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items, config):
    selected_items = []
    deselected_items = []

    for item in items:
        if 'new_fixture' in getattr(item, 'fixturenames', ()):
            selected_items.append(item)
        else:
            deselected_items.append(item)
    config.hook.pytest_deselected(items=deselected_items)
    items[:] = selected_items
```

```python
# test_foobar.py

import pytest


@pytest.fixture
def new_fixture():
    return 'foobar'


@pytest.fixture
def another_fixture(new_fixture):
    return 'foobar'


def test_abc(new_fixture):
    assert True


def test_def(another_fixture):
    assert False


def test_that_does_not_use_fixture():
    assert False
```

tldr: Use the ``pytest_collection_modifyitems`` hook to select only tests that use a certain fixture
