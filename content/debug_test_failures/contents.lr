# Tracebacks
Pytest excels at helping you with test failures.  After running your tests via
py.test, you will see an error report with a detailed traceback for each of the
failures, if any.  You can change the mode in which output is presented to you
via the ``--tb`` cli option:

```text
py.test --tb=auto    # (default) 'long' tracebacks for the first and last
                     # entry, but 'short' style for the other entries
py.test --tb=long    # exhaustive, informative traceback formatting
py.test --tb=short   # shorter traceback format
py.test --tb=line    # only one line per failure
py.test --tb=native  # Python standard library formatting
py.test --tb=no      # no traceback at all
```

# Debugger
Have you ever heard of [pdb - the Python Debugger][pdb]?
I strongly recommend checking it out, if you haven't used it yet. The standard
library's built-in debugger will prove useful for debugging your Python code
without installing any external dependencies or setting up some fancy IDE.

If invoked with the ``--pdb`` option, pytest will place a debugger breakpoint
whenever an error occurs in your tests.

```text
$ py.test --pdb
```
You can also set a debugger breakpoint yourself with ``import pdb;
pdb.set_trace()``.

Use commands ``help``, ``list`` and ``pp`` to inspect the test code.

If you want to get a list of all local variables and their value, it's best to
run pytest with the ``-l`` option enabled, as ``locals()`` may contain internal
pytest items if you print it from the breakpoint.

# Running Broken Tests Only
An underrated feature of pytest is the ``--lf`` option, which tells pytest to
only run the tests that failed the last time it was executed.

Once you've encountered any errors in your tests, you want to focus on the
failures and get a better understanding of what's causing the problems as
opposed to spending time on running tests that are perfectly fine.

# Re-order Tests. Failures First
Keep in mind though, whenever you modify your code other tests may break.

If you run ``$ py.test --ff`` all tests will be executed, but re-ordered based
on whether they've failed in the previous run or not. Failures first,
successful tests after.

# Stop Tests After N Failures
You can end the test session early by pressing ``CTRL-C``. Although pytest
catches the ``KeyboardInterrupt`` error and runs the teardown code before
closing the session gracefully, it is definitely not the best way to stop the
test suite.

Instead use ``-x`` to stop after the first failure, or ``--maxfail=N`` to stop
after the first N failures.

tldr: Combine options ``-x``, ``-l``, ``--lf`` and ``--tb=long`` to analyze
results. Drop to the built-in debugger with ``--pdb``.
